# Docker FastAPI Containerizer Skill

This skill provides comprehensive Docker support for Python/FastAPI applications, from basic containerization to production-ready deployments.

## Overview

The Docker FastAPI Containerizer skill helps developers containerize their Python/FastAPI applications with best practices for security, performance, and maintainability. It includes:

- Dockerfile templates for various use cases (simple, multi-stage, production)
- Docker Compose configurations for multi-service applications
- Security best practices implementation
- Production-ready configurations
- Helper scripts for initialization

## Features

- **Smart Dockerfile Generation**: Creates optimized Dockerfiles based on application structure
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Reduces image size and improves security
- **Security Hardening**: Implements non-root users, minimal base images, and secure configurations
- **Docker Compose Support**: Multi-service application orchestration
- **Production Patterns**: Ready-to-use configurations for production deployments
- **Helper Scripts**: Automated setup and configuration tools

## Usage

### Automatic Detection and Setup

The skill automatically detects FastAPI applications and creates appropriate Docker configurations:

1. Navigate to your FastAPI project directory
2. Run the initialization script to create Docker configuration files
3. Customize the generated files as needed
4. Build and deploy your containerized application

### Manual Configuration

Review the reference documentation for detailed patterns and best practices:
- Dockerfile best practices (`references/dockerfile-best-practices.md`)
- Docker Compose configurations (`references/docker-compose-configurations.md`)
- Security guidelines (`references/security-best-practices.md`)

## Components

- `SKILL.md`: Main skill documentation and usage instructions
- `references/`: Detailed documentation on Docker best practices
- `scripts/init-docker.sh`: Initialization script for creating Docker configuration files
- `.dockerignore`: Pre-configured ignore file for Docker builds

## Best Practices Implemented

- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Non-root user execution for security
- Minimal base images (slim/alpine variants)
- Proper environment variable handling
- Health checks for production readiness
- Resource limits for container management
- Secrets management for sensitive data
- Layer caching optimization
- Proper logging configuration

## Production Considerations

When deploying to production, consider:
- Using Docker Hardened Images (DHI) for enhanced security
- Implementing secrets management
- Adding health checks and monitoring
- Setting appropriate resource limits
- Using environment-specific configurations
- Regular security scanning of images
