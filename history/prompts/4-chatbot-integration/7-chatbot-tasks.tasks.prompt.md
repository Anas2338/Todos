## Task Breakdown Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive task breakdown for the chatbot frontend integration feature with:

- **45 specific tasks** organized across 7 phases
- **Proper formatting** following the checklist format (checkboxes, IDs, story labels)
- **User story alignment** with priorities P1, P2, and P3
- **Dependency mapping** showing task completion order
- **Parallel execution opportunities** identified for efficient development
- **Independent test criteria** defined for each user story

The tasks are organized in logical phases starting with setup, followed by foundational components, then user story-specific implementation, and concluding with error handling, authentication, and polish. Each task includes specific file paths and is detailed enough for implementation without additional context.
